## June

- [ ] Create starting documentation for dmen-vis
- [ ] Understand logic for `app.R`
- [ ] Understand logic for `multiplot.R`
- [ ] create `scan_conform()` to generalize `scan_conform10_14` and `scan_conform7_10`

Should this be made into a tool that generates plots on scans? That would be more useful that an application specifically designed for analyzing one specific type of data. Plots can be isolated based on given parameters. I shouldn't need to completely understand the data to be able to code a useful application for this.
